# Tailoring Stitcher Cost Calculator

This is a simple React application that helps users calculate the total stitching cost for tailoring items. Users can select an item, choose extra add-ons, and pick a delivery type to see the final price.

## Features

- Select from four tailoring items (A, B, C, D) with different base prices.
- Add optional extras: Lining, Embroidery, Extra Buttons.
- Choose between normal and urgent delivery (urgent adds an extra charge).
- Instantly calculates and displays the total cost.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the app using Vite. The terminal will show a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

3. **Open the app**  
   Visit the URL shown in your terminal in your web browser.
